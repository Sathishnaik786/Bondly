# Chat Assistant Implementation

## Overview
The chat assistant is a floating widget that appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen. It provides users with instant access to support and information.

## Features
- Floating chat button in the bottom-right corner
- Expandable chat window with message history
- Minimize/close functionality
- Live chat initiation from the Contact section
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Global availability across all pages (landing, login, signup, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Components
1. **ChatAssistant** (`src/components/chat-assistant.tsx`)
   - Main chat component with state management
   - Message display with user/assistant differentiation
   - Input area with send functionality
   - Window controls (minimize/close)

2. **Contact Component** (`src/components/landing/contact.tsx`)
   - "Start Live Chat" button that triggers the chat assistant

3. **Client Layout** (`src/app/client-layout.tsx`)
   - Global integration point for the ChatAssistant component
   - Ensures chat assistant appears on all pages

### How It Works
1. The ChatAssistant component is mounted globally in the client layout
2. Clicking the floating chat button sets `isOpen` to true
3. The "Start Live Chat" button in the Contact section dispatches a custom event (`openChatAssistant`)
4. The ChatAssistant listens for this event and opens when received
5. Messages are stored in state with sender information and timestamps
6. The chat window can be minimized or closed using the header controls

### Custom Events
- `openChatAssistant`: Opens the chat assistant when dispatched

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Additional custom CSS in `src/app/chat-styles.css` for positioning and effects
- Responsive design with fixed positioning
- Smooth animations for opening/closing
- Clear visual distinction between user and assistant messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

1. **Chat Assistant Not Displaying**
   - Ensure the component is properly imported and mounted in the client layout
   - Check that z-index is high enough (set to 9999)
   - Verify CSS positioning (fixed, bottom, right)
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

2. **"Start Live Chat" Button Not Working**
   - Verify that the custom event listener is properly set up
   - Ensure window object is available (client-side only)
   - Check that the event name matches exactly

3. **Styling Issues**
   - Confirm Tailwind CSS is properly configured
   - Check that custom CSS file is imported
   - Verify that there are no CSS conflicts

## Usage
1. The ChatAssistant component is now globally available on all pages through the client layout
2. Use the "Start Live Chat" button in contact forms to trigger the chat
3. Customize the initial messages and responses as needed

## Recent Fixes
- Improved positioning with dedicated CSS classes
- Added window object checks for server-side rendering compatibility
- Enhanced z-index to ensure visibility
- Fixed event listener cleanup
- Implemented global availability through client layout

## Future Enhancements
